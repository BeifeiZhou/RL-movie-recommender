\begin{abstract}
  The purpose of our research is to study reinforcement learning approaches to building a movie recommender system. We formulate the problem of interactive recommendation as a contextual multi-armed bandit, learning user preferences recommanding new movies and receiving their ratings. We show that using reinforcement learning solves the problem of exploitation-exploration tradeoff and the cold-start problem. We integrate the novelty of movies to the model. We explore a content based approach as well as a collaborative filtering approach and both yield viable recommendation results.

\section{Introduction}


Individuals sometimes have to settle on decisions without sufficient personal experience of the several choices. On a regular daily basis, their decisions depend on recommendations, advices and opinions from other individuals either by listening in conversations or by direct suggestion of movies, tv shows, holiday destinations, etc. Recommender systems help and enlarge this normal social process.

In a recommender system, individuals usually give behaviour information as data sources, which the system then use to learn users preferences in order to provide recommendation. The recommender's value lies in its capacity to make great matches between the recommenders and those looking for suggestions. Such systems are the strength of content providers such as Netflix \cite{netflix-article-recommender} and YouTube \footnote{http://www.youtube.com}, allowing them to make their content more attractive in order to increase views and to optimise the monetisation of their videos. It allows to infer the customer's center of interest and, if customers share some general behaviour, to detect improvements in content that can be made to better meet the expectations of the public. 


This work follows the steps of \cite{main} who have implemented a music recommendation system using reinforcement learning. In \cite{main}, they explain what could be done to adapt their work to movies recommandation and suggest to try a collaborative filtering approach. In our work, we first adapt their strategies to movies recommandation and then we try on some approaches they suggest.

The problem of movie recommandation is modeled as a contextual multi-armed bandit [\cite{sutton1998reinforcement}] [\cite{lu2010contextual}] which gives us the following advantages.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Learning incorporates user feedback (i.e. ratings of movies) into recommandations thus fitting diversity in users preferences, as opposed to \textit{context-free} multi-armed bandit,
	\item The model can take into account both a content based approaches and a collaborative filtering approaches,
	\item The model can use any type of features,
	\item Using a good policy balances exploration and exploitation thus mitigating the problems of cold-start and novelty.
\end{itemize}


In the following sections, we will first introduce the methods used. Then we will review the results we obtained before discussing them.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data mining}

The data used is originated from IMDb \footnote{http://www.imdb.com/}. It is twofolds. The first part is a movie catalog containing relevant information about each movies such as the genre, keywords describing the content, the year, the mean rating and number of votes. That part is publicly available from IMDb FTP in a homemade format. The second part of data is RSS flux of movies watched and rated by IMDb users containing the title of the movie along with the rating and the time it was watched.

\subsection{Features extraction and selection}

The first challenge was to extract the features from the IMDb homemade format and convert it into a clearer \textit{csv} format.

In order to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, to focus on the learning matter and to avoid transforming the problem into a big data and parallelisation problem, a subset of movies and users was picked, counting up to about 430.000 user-movie pair. We picked the 1000 movies with the most votes and all users who have at least 50 ratings for those movies. This create a bias in the data, that we will need to evaluate in a future work based on full real-life data.

To keep the features vector simple, we selected only the genre and year for each movie. Those two features are categorical variable and in order to learn a single weight per feature (i.e. drama, crime, ..), a onehot encoding has been applied resulting in a blow up of the feature space to $n$ features, $n$ being the number of category.

... & ... & ... &  ...  &  ... \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
}

\subsection{Dimension reduction}

The feature space resulting from the feature extraction process is quite large, making the recommendation computational intensive.
In order to deal with that problem, the feature space size has been reduced using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) [\cite{principalcompanalysis}].

The principal components analysis is a machine learning procedure that apply an orthogonal transformation to the dataset in order to obtain a new set of values that minimises the covariance. Those new variables are called principal components. There are ordered in term of variance, the first principal component having the highest variance and so on. When the procedure is applied a reduction to n-dimension consists of keeping the n-first principal components thus removing first the components with lesser variance.

For our dataset we kept the 20-first principal components out of about 50, keeping about 83\% of the variance of the original dataset.

\subsection{Multi armed bandit modelling}

The multi-armed bandit is a intensively studied reinforcement learning dilemma. It consists of a bandit (usually a casino slot machine) with $K$ arms, each giving a payoff $r$ sampled from an unknown probability distribution $p_{i}$. The player has a defined $n$ number of pulls and its goal is to choose wisely which arm to play in order to maximise the total payoff.

The movie recommendation problem can be seen as a bandit problem where each arm is a movie and a user can pull it (watch it). The reward or loss or can be seen as the difference between the expected rating of a movie for a suer and the the true rating given as a feedback by the user. As the number of arm is gigantic and each arm are not even played once, an heuristic is used to help the system into choosing an arm. The heuristic can be content based or a collaborative filtering.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{img/schema.png}
\caption{Seeing a movie recommender as a multi-armed bandit problem}
\label{schema}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Content based}

The content based heuristic try to find a movie that is close to the learned user preferences $\theta$. It takes into account the movie genre, movie year and novelty. Novelty can be defined as if the movie as been recently watched or not.

The movie genre and movie year can be considered as a onehot encoded vector $x$.
Without considering other factor, the utility of a user for a movie can be represented as the following.

\begin{center}
	$ \ U_{c} = \theta^{T} * x$ 
\end{center}

Distinctive users have different preferences $\theta$. Also, we do the hypothesis of a stationary true value for $\theta$, meaning that while, we learn the user preference, its preferences stay the same.

The novelty is defined using the forgetting curve proposed by \cite{ebbinghaus1913memory} and defined as $ e^{\frac{t}{s}} $ with $t$ being the current time and $s$ an hyper-parameter defining how fast we forget and want a repetition. Obviously for movie an higher value of $s$ is needed compared to an $s$ that would be used for music. The utility for a user in term of novelty can be defined as follows.

\begin{center}
	$ \ U_{n} = 1 - e^{\frac{t}{s}} $ 
\end{center}

The combined utility or more explicitly the expected rating for a movie and a user is defined as follows.

\begin{center}
	$ \ U = \ U_{c} *  U_{n} = (\theta^{T} * x) * (1 - e^{\frac{t}{s}}) $ 
\end{center}

The last task of the recommender is then to propose the movie with the highest expected rating to the user and update the user preferences $\theta$ according to the difference in rating received and predicted.

\subsubsection{Collaborative filtering}

The collaborative filtering heuristic try to find a movie that is a liked movie by a similar user. It takes into account others users rating and novelty of a movie.

The algorithm will start by finding a cluster of the user and $k$ others users by associating of the most similar user in clusters. The association is done by calculating the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient on preferences $\theta$ of the targeted user and others users. Then cluster users rating are considerate to be the utility of the user for those movie. In others words, similar user's movies rating become targeted user utility for those movies.

\begin{center}
	$ \ U_{f} = u $ 
\end{center}

Note that others users rating are weighted by the average means they give to movie to avoid biais.

The novelty if defined similarly as above, so the expected rating is :

\begin{center}
	$ \ U = \ U_{f} *  U_{n} = u * (1 - e^{\frac{t}{s}}) $ 
\end{center}



\subsection{Bandit strategies}

Many strategy to find an approximate solution have been developed over the years. A review of them is explain by \cite{kuleshov2014algorithms}.

\subsubsection{Random}

The random strategy is not a real strategy per se. It is a strategy where the player will only do exploration. It is mostly used as a basis to compare the effectiveness in term of reward or regret of an other algorithm.

\subsubsection{Greedy-epsilon}

The $\epsilon-greedy$ algorithm is widely used because it is fairly simple. For each round of the simulation, the algorithm selects the arm (movie) with the highest expected value based on the context vector with a probability of $1-\epsilon$ and selects a random arm with a probability $\epsilon$.

\subsubsection{Greedy time dependent}

The greedy time dependent is a variation of the previously mentioned greedy where $\epsilon$ variated over time in order to maximise the exploration at first and reduce it in order to increase exploitation over time.

\begin{center}
	$\epsilon = \frac{1}{\sqrt{t+1}}$
\end{center}

However, the effectiveness of variating $\epsilon$ over time is disputed by \cite{vermorel2005multi} whose did not find any practical advantage to using these method. As a result, we will test both approaches.

\subsection{Simulation}

We conducted an empirical efficiency study of the algorithms mentioned above as well as the content based and collaborative filtering modelling. 

Experiments were conducted on personal computer and the programming language $python$ was used to implement models and algorithms.

The simulation consisted on simulating the interaction of a user and a recommender. Results can be found in section \ref{results} \todo{explain the simulation better}

\subsection{Metrics}

In order to evaluate our algorithms and models in term of movie recommendation performance, an assortment of metrics retained. They could be formalised as follows.

\subsubsection{Cumulative regret}

For the $l$-th recommendation, the regret is defined as the difference between the maximum expected rating $ E[R^{l}] = max_{k=1...|S|} U_{k} $  and the expected rating $E[\hat R^{l}]$ of the recommended song is  $\Delta_{l} = E[\hat{R} ^{l}] - E[R^{l}]$. The cumulative regret for the $n$-th recommendation is then $ \sum_{l=1}^{n} \Delta_{l} = E[\hat{R} ^{l}] - E[R^{l}]$

\subsubsection{Accuracy (RMSE)}

The root-mean-square error is a frequently used measure of the difference between the predicted value and the actually observed value. In our case, the root-mean-square error will be the square of the difference between the expected value for the rating and the actual rating given by the user.

\subsubsection{Average rating}

The average rating is the simplest metric consisting of only the observed rating. It is interesting because it is a good indicator of how the user liked the recommendation.

\subsubsection{Computation time}

The last metric is the time needed to compute a recommendation. Indeed, usually a recommendation should be computed in a reasonable time, the system can't afford to make the user wait for several minutes before giving him a recommendation. However, one could argues that the computation could be parallelized on multi-core or on a big data cluster and.  \todo{dernier phrase in discussion}
